## Neural_Network_Optimization_basing_on_Multi_Variable_Gradient_for_Curve
Use knowledge of Multivariable Gradient to optimize an Neural network to train out a target curve. 

** acknowledge **
this in fact is myself knowledge reflection after taking course Multi Variable Calculus from Imperial College. The course is very helpful and , if you also want to learn multi variable calculus , I really recommend it to you. you can find it from coursera.org.

### purpuse
we train a simple Neural network to create a 2-D curve.  we can get all key concept like neural components structure, gradient and etc here.

### read the code
1. training_data() : this func created training data.   y_x[] and y_y[] are the x-y coordination of the target curve.
2. network_function(): create simple weight-sum network. and I am using cosh func as flag function here.

### result
1. you can modify the training_data() to create your own target plot
2. original curve will be plot blue, iteration curve is pink, final result after all iteration is green.

### most important
have fun! let's try to analyze the world from math view.
